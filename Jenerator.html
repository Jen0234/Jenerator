        <h2>Questions</h2>

        <ul>
            <il>1. How secure are the generated passwords?</il>
            <p> It's crucial to understand the importance of using strong passwords. Using online random generated passwords is always a better option than using weak passwords that are prone to hacking. It's essential to keep your online accounts and personal information safe from cyber attacks, and generating strong passwords is a great way to do it.</p>
            
            <il>2. What is the recommended length for a password?</il>
            <p>It's important to set a strong password policy to ensure the security of user accounts. The Minimum password length policy setting allows you to specify the minimum number of characters required for a user password. You can choose a value between 1 and 10 characters, or you can choose to not require a password by setting the value to 0. Remember, the longer the password, the harder it is for someone to guess or crack it. So, it is recommended to set a minimum length of at least 8 characters.</p>

            <il> 3. Can a Passcode be more secure than a Password?</il>
            <p>Here's what you need to know: The password is mainly used to log in to the mobile app. Usually, you won't need to enter your password because the app will keep running in the background of your smart device. On the other hand, the passcode is a four-digit PIN that you can enable inside the app for added security. However, this feature is optional.</p>
            
            <il>4. How often should a user change their password?</il>
            <p>In the past, people were often advised to change their passwords every three months as a security measure. However, research has shown that this practice may not be as helpful as once thought. In fact, changing your passwords too frequently could lead to weaker passwords or even cause you to forget them. Ultimately, it‚Äôs important to strike a balance between ensuring security and convenience when it comes to managing your passwords.</p>
            
            <il>5. What are the best practices for creating a strong password?</il>
            <p> To create a strong password,<br> it's recommended to follow these guidelines:<br>
        
                - The password should be at least 12 characters long,  but 14 or more is even better. <br>
               - Use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.<br>
                   - Avoid using a word that can be found in a dictionary or the name of a person, character, product, or organization.<br>
                        - Make sure the password is significantly different from your previous passwords.<br>
                           - Try to use a memorable phrase like "<em>^IL0v3_M3</em>" that is easy for you to remember but difficult for others to guess.</p>
